COMMUNECTED : get connected to your city
===========
COMMUNECTED is part of the citizen's toolbox developped by the open-source network : HUMAN PIXEL.
With simply an email and his postal code, a citizen get connected to his city and all its actors.
Through a dynamic interface each citizen can :
- get linked to any fellow citizen sharing his interests,
- interact with locals organisations (associations or entreprises)
- and communicate directly with his town hall.
Easily connected with their proximity network, citizens build local value from the usefulness of their interaction.
More  aware of neighbourhood intiatives and stake, citizens can get more involved in district council decisions and local actions.
